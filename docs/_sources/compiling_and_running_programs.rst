Compiling and Running Programs
==============================

Let's consider the simple example program from Section :ref:`Writing Intel速 
SHMEM Programs<writing_programs>` and assume the code is in a file called 
``ishmem_example.cpp``.

To compile the program, we must pass the necessary flags to the Intel速
oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.
For example::

$ icpx -I${ISHMEM_INSTALL_DIR}/include -L${ISHMEM_INSTALL_DIR}/lib -fsycl -std=gnu++1z ishmem_example.cpp -o ishmem_example -lsma -lpmi -lze_loader -ldl

where ``ISHMEM_INSTALL_DIR`` is the path to the Intel速 SHMEM
installation directory.

Intel速 SHMEM provides a launcher script, ``ishmrun`` that
assigns the environment variable **ZE_AFFINITY_MASK** so that each PE is
assigned a single SYCL device.
To invoke the ``ishmrun`` script, pass it as the first argument to your
process launcher.
The following example assumes the ``ISHMEM_INSTALL_DIR/bin`` directory is
on your user path and use of the Portable Batch System launcher::

$ aprun -N 12 -n 6 ishmrun ishmem_example

This will launch the example program on 12 PEs with 6 PEs per compute node.
