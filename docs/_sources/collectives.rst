Collective Operations
---------------------

.. important:: Intel速 SHMEM does not yet support teams-based
   collectives.  All collectives must operate on the world team.

.. important:: All collective operations must complete before another kernel
   calls collective operations.

.. important:: A collective call must be either all host-initiated or
   device-initiated. For example, a program that initiate a collective
   operation from the host on some PEs but from the device on other PEs has
   undefined behavior.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISHMEM_BARRIER_ALL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registers the arrival of a PE at a barrier and blocks the PE until all other
PEs arrive at the barrier and all local updates and remote memory updates are
completed.

.. cpp:function:: void ishmem_barrier_all()

Callable from the **host** and **device**.

**Description:**
The ``ishmem_barrier_all`` routine is a mechanism for synchronizing all PEs
in the world team at once.
This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmem_barrier_all``.

.. In a multithreaded Intel速 SHMEM program, only the calling thread is blocked,
.. however, it may not be called concurrently by multiple threads in the same
.. PE.

Prior to synchronizing with other PEs, ``ishmem_barrier_all`` ensures
completion of all previously issued memory stores, and of all local and remote
memory updates issued via ``ishmem`` AMO and RMA routine calls such as
``ishmem_int_add``, ``ishmem_put_nbi``, and ``ishmem_get_nbi``.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISHMEMX_BARRIER_ALL_WORK_GROUP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registers the arrival of a PE at a barrier and blocks the PE until all other
PEs arrive at the barrier and all local updates and remote memory updates are
completed.

.. cpp:function:: template<typename Group> void ishmemx_barrier_all_work_group(const Group& group)

  :param group: The SYCL ``group`` or ``sub_group`` on which to collectively perform the barrier operation.

Callable from the **device**.

**Description:**
The ``ishmemx_barrier_all_work_group`` routine is a mechanism for
synchronizing all PEs.
Unlike ``ishmem_barrier_all``, ``ishmemx_barrier_all_work_group`` allows
for the device threads within **group** to cooperate towards the barrier
operation.
This may be more performant; for example, when ``ishmem_barrier_all``
requires `all` device threads in the kernel to invoke RMA operations.
This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmemx_barrier_all_work_group``.
All threads in **group** must call the routine with identical arguments.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISHMEM_SYNC_ALL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registers the arrival of a PE at a synchronization point and suspends
execution until all other PEs arrive at the synchronization point.

.. cpp:function:: void ishmem_sync_all()

Callable from the **host** and the **device**.

**Description:**
This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmem_sync_all``.

.. In a multithreaded Intel速 SHMEM program, only the calling thread is blocked.

In contrast with the ``ishmem_barrier_all`` routines, ``ishmem_sync_all``
only ensures completion and visibility of previously issued memory
stores and does not ensure completion of remote memory updates issued via
``ishmem`` routines.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISHMEMX_SYNC_ALL_WORK_GROUP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registers the arrival of a PE at a synchronization point and suspends
execution until all other PEs arrive at the synchronization point.

.. cpp:function:: template<typename Group> void ishmemx_sync_all_work_group(const Group& group)

  :param group: The SYCL ``group`` or ``sub_group`` on which to collectively perform the barrier operation.

Callable from the **device**.

**Description:**
This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmemx_sync_all_work_group``.

.. In a multithreaded Intel速 SHMEM program, only the calling thread is blocked.

In contrast with the ``ishmem_sync_all`` routine, ``ishmemx_sync_all_work_group`` allows for the device threads within **group** to cooperate towards the sync operation.
This may be more performant; for example, when ``ishmem_sync_all``
requires `all` device threads in the kernel to invoke RMA operations.
This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmemx_sync_all_work_group``.
``ishmemx_sync_all_work_group`` only ensures completion and visibility of
previously issued memory stores and does not ensure completion of remote
memory updates issued via ``ishmem`` routines.
All threads in **group** must call the routine with identical arguments.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISHMEM_ALLTOALL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exchanges a fixed amount of contiguous data blocks between all pairs of PEs
participating in the collective routine.

.. cpp:function:: int ishmem_TYPENAME_alltoall(TYPE* dest, const TYPE* source, size_t nelems)

.. cpp:function:: int ishmem_alltoallmem(void* dest, const void* source, size_t nelems)

   :param dest: Symmetric address of a data object large enough to receive the combined total of **nelems** elements from each PE. The type of **dest** should match the TYPE and TYPENAME according to the table of :ref:`Standard RMA types<stdrmatypes>`.
   :param source: Symmetric address of a data object that contains **nelems** elements of data for each PE, ordered according to destination PE. The type of **source** should match the TYPE and TYPENAME according to the table of :ref:`Standard RMA types<stdrmatypes>`.
   :param nelems: The number of elements to exchange for each PE. For ``ishmem_alltoallmem``, elements are bytes.
   :returns:  zero on successful local completion; otherwise, nonzero.

Callable from the **host** and **device**.

**Description:**
The ``ishmem_alltoall`` routines are collective routines. Each PE
participating in the operation exchanges **nelems** data elements
with all other PEs participating in the operation.
The size of a data element is 8 bits for ``ishmem_alltoallmem``.

The data being sent and received are stored in a contiguous symmetric data
object.
The total size of each PE's **source** object and **dest** object is **nelems**
times the size of an element times `N`, where `N` equals the number of PEs
participating in the operation.
The **source** object contains `N` blocks of data (where the size of each block
is defined by **nelems**) and each block of data is sent to a different PE.

The same **dest** and **source** arrays, and same value for **nelems** must be
passed by all PEs that participate in the collective.

.. FIXME: TEAMS

.. Given a PE `i` that is the `k`:sup:`th` PE participating in the operation and a
.. PE `j` that is the `l`:sup:`th` PE participating in the operation, PE `i` sends
.. the `l`:sup:`th` block of its **source** object to the `k`:sup:`th` block of
.. the **dest** object of PE `j`.

Given a PE `i` that is the `i`:sup:`th` PE participating in the operation and a
PE `j` that is the `j`:sup:`th` PE participating in the operation, PE `i` sends
the `j`:sup:`th` block of its **source** object to the `i`:sup:`th` block of
the **dest** object of PE `j`.

All PEs must participate in the collective.

Before any PE calls a ``ishmem_alltoall`` routine, the following conditions must
be ensured:

.. FIXME: PSYNC?

#. The **dest** data object on all PEs is ready to accept the
   ``ishmem_alltoall`` data.
#. The **source** data object on all PEs is ready to send.

Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Upon return from a ``ishmem_alltoall`` routine, the following is true for
the local PE:

#. Its **dest** symmetric data object is completely updated.
#. The data has been copied out of the **source** data object.

   :param group: The SYCL ``group`` or ``sub_group`` on which to collectively perform the barrier operation.
   :returns:  zero on successful local completion; otherwise, nonzero.

Callable from the **device**.

**Description:**
The ``ishmemx_alltoall_work_group`` routines have similar semantics and
requirements as the ``ishmem_alltoall`` routines.
In contrast with the ``ishmem_alltoall`` routines,
``ishmemx_alltoall_work_group`` allows for the device threads within **group**
to cooperate towards the all-to-all operation.
This may be more performant; for example, when ``ishmem_alltoall``
requires `all` device threads in the kernel to invoke RMA operations.
This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmemx_alltoall_work_group``.
``ishmemx_alltoall_work_group`` only ensures completion and visibility of
previously issued memory stores and does not ensure completion of remote memory
updates issued via ``ishmem`` routines.
All threads in **group** must call the routine with identical arguments.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ISHMEM_BROADCAST
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   :param PE_root: The PE from which the data is copied.
   :returns:  zero on successful local completion; otherwise, nonzero.

Callable from the **host** and **device**.

**Description:**
The broadcast routines are collective routines across all PEs.
They copy the **source** data object on the PE specified by **PE_root** to
the **dest** data object on the PEs participating in the collective
operation.
The same **dest** and **source** data objects and the same value of
**PE_root** must be passed by all PEs participating in the collective
operation.

For broadcasts:

* The **dest** object is updated on all PEs.

* All PEs must participate in the operation.

* The values of argument **PE_root** must be the same value on all PEs.

* The value of **PE_root** must be between 0 and **PE_size** - 1.

Before any PE calls a broadcast routine, the following conditions must be
ensured:

* The **dest** array on all PEs participating in the broadcast is ready to accept the broadcast data.

Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Upon return from a broadcast routine, the following are true for the local
PE:

* The **dest** data object is updated on all PEs.

* The **source** data object may be safely reused.

**Description:**
The ``ishmemx_broadcast_work_group`` and
``ishmemx_broadcastmem_work_group`` routines have similar semantics and

**Description:**
``ishmem`` reduction routines are collective routines over all PEs that
compute one or more reductions across symmetric arrays.
A reduction performs an associative binary routine across a set of values.

The **nreduce** argument determines the number of separate reductions to
perform.
The **source** array on all PEs provides one element for each reduction.
The results of the reductions are placed in the **dest** array on all PEs.

The **source** and **dest** arguments must either be the same symmetric
address, or two different symmetric addresses corresponding to buffers that
do not overlap in memory. That is, they must be completely overlapping or
completely disjoint.

.. Team-based reduction routines operate over all PEs in the provided team
.. argument. All PEs in the provided team must participate in the reduction.
.. If **team** compares equal to ``ISHMEM_TEAM_INVALID`` or is otherwise
.. invalid, the behavior is undefined.

Before any PE calls a reduction routine, the following conditions must be
ensured:

* The **dest** array on all PEs participating in the reduction is ready to
  accept the results of the reduction.

Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Upon return from a reduction routine, the following are true for the local

This routine blocks the calling PE until all PEs have called
``ishmemx_reduce_work_group``.
``ishmemx_reduce_work_group`` only ensures completion and visibility of
previously issued memory stores and does not ensure completion of remote
memory updates issued via ``ishmem`` routines.
All threads in **group** must call the routine with identical arguments.

.. important:: For the reduction operations ``sum`` and ``prod``, the order of
   reduction may not be the same across all PEs, so the results for floating
   point datatypes may differ slightly. This is because floating addition and
   multiplication are not associative operations.
